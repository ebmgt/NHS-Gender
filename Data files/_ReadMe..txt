NHS results are downloaded from https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/results/results-archive/.
The files for each year are downloaded as a zip file that contains three xlsx files with national, organizational type, and organizational results. 

In this directory is our file after merging the files from 2021 through 2024.
